Essentially an image is an array of values, and what those values mean depends on the mapping process that is being applied. They could indicate…

1. Look up (Direct Replacement Value)

2. Image Masking (Color should come from?)

3. Highlighting ( Pixels to be darked or lighted)

4. Blurring pixels at locations.

5. Distortion (Specifying a source co-ordinate)

6. Displacement (Location relative to current position)
